## Accelerating Shapley Explanation via Contributive Cooperator Selection 

### Research Motivation

Explaining the behavior of deep neural networks (DNNs) is a significant problem according to not only the practical requirement and but also the regulations in different domains.
Among the state-of-art techniques of DNN interpretation, the Shapley value provides a natural and effective explanation from the perspective of cooperative game theory. 
However, the calculation of Shapley value is known to be an NP-hard problem with extremely high computational complexity. 
To solve this problem, we propose <b>SHEAR</b> for efficient Shapley value estimation in this repo.
           
### Research Challenges  

The brute-force algorithm to calculate exact Shapley values requires the enumeration of all possible feature coalitions, where the complexity grows exponentially with the feature number.
To address this issue, SHEAR only involves few feature coalitions for the estimation.
In such a manner, the enumeration throughout the whole feature space can be avoided such that the computational efficiency can be significantly improved. 

### SHEAR Framework

As shown in the following figure, given a DNN model <i>f</i> and feature value <b>x</b> = [x<sub>1</sub>,··· ,x<sub>M</sub>], SHEAR estimates the contribution of each feature independently.
Specifically, for each feature, SHEAR first calculates its cross-contribution with other features; 
then greedily selects the contributive cooperators to maximize the cumulative cross-contribution; 
finally estimates the feature contribution throughout the coalitions of contributive cooperators.

### Time Complexity of SHEAR

SHEAR has one model backward process to calculate the gradient for cross-contribution estimation, and <i>N</i> model forward process for feature contribution estimation. 
Hence, SHEAR has the time consumption given by <i>T<sub>SHEAR</sub> ≈ t<sub>backward</sub> + N t<sub>forward</sub></i> for single feature
contribution estimation.
Considering to interpretation of a model <i>f</i> having <i>M</i> features, we process the <i>M</i> features consecutively in this repo, where the overall time-cost increases to <i>M</i> times of single feature.
The strucuture can be improved via parallel processing of the <i>M</i> features.
